The experiential branding directed the journey of the audience through an achievement’s installation, tents for supporting NGO’s, instant hot press t-shirts allowing the audience to choose their persona, a huge drawing board to engage the audience to make their mark, a timeline installation to showcase the 3 years’ development, and finally a photobooth bus “bosta” to commemorate the 3-year ride. The design took an illustrative style working with our personas to give anonymity and inclusion to the audience. Overall, the experience was humane, close to the heart and personal.','','','','1',9,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(544,62,'','','','1616085071.jpg','2',10,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(547,2,'','','','1616496532.jpg','1',0,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(548,63,'','','','1616496568.jpg','2',2,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(549,63,'','','','1616496591.jpg','2',3,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(550,63,'','','','1616503670.jpg','2',5,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(551,63,'A key insight that lead the online creative campaign was a simple fact: Many people are not well informed on the Kafala System and what it entails. We have been used to this system for a very long time and never found reason to question it. Our challenge was to create awareness on the ins and outs of the Kafala System and shed light on the injustices and hardships that those under the system suffered from. \r\n\r\nWe based our approach on data shared by the EU and Caritas Lebanon and an existing TVC: we needed to sensitize the general public and help them understand the various dimensions of the issue and its scale: discrimination and racism, labor and human rights violations and the vulnerabilities that the Kafala system inflicts on the MDWs. ','','','','1',4,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(554,63,'We launched the online creative campaign that followed the TVC with a main objective to keep our audience empathetic: Get the real-life horrors out and put the audience in the MDW’s shoes. At the time of the campaign’s roll out, Lebanon was going through the pandemic, the Beirut port explosion along with the deflated economic situation. During this particular time, a big number of MDWs were fleeing from their work and employers. Most MDWs found refuge at the Caritas shelter and we were lucky to be able to document the real stories caused by the Kafala System. We used a reverse role concept through social media interactive stories where again the audience saw life through the MDW’s eyes. The campaign went further to educate the public on “what is the Kafala system?” and a call to action on how to create change and give MDWs their rights and humanity back.','','','','1',9,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(555,63,'','','','1616498101.jpg','2',11,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(556,63,'','','','1616498267.jpg','2',12,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(557,63,'','','','1616498368.jpg','2',10,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(558,63,'','','https://vimeo.com/527753492','','4',6,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(559,63,'','','https://vimeo.com/527752458','','4',7,0,1,1,NULL,NULL),(560,63,'','','https://vimeo.com/527751098','','4',8,0,1,1,NULL,NULL);
